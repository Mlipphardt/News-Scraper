# How it works
---
Using the application online is as easy as clicking the "Scrape Articles" button! Articles can be cleared with the "Clear Articles" button. Each article can be saved, in which case it will be displayed upon clicking the "Favorites" link on the navigation bar. Clicking on "Notes" allows users to add comments to each article. If desired, these comments can be deleted by clicking on the red "x" in the corner of the comment. 

# The tech behind it
* JavaScript with Node.js for server code.
* Handlebars for html templating.
* MongoDB for NoSQL database to store articles and commented notes.
* Jquery for dynamic html updating.
